<h2>I Got Called to Fix a Beautiful but Invisible Website</h2>
<p>“Our site is awesome, but no one’s finding us on Google.” That’s how the call started. I was brought in as an SEO consultant for a B2B company that had spent big on a redesign — but saw zero growth in traffic or leads.</p>
<p>The site? Gorgeous. Parallax effects. Bold fonts. Interactive sections. But from an SEO lens? It was a nightmare.</p>

<h2>What SEO Saw That Design Didn’t</h2>
<p>I ran a quick audit. Within minutes, I saw the usual suspects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No clear H1 — all the headers were styled divs</li>
  <li>Images with no alt text (including the logo)</li>
  <li>JavaScript-heavy content that crawlers couldn’t even see</li>
  <li>No schema markup for services, FAQs, or articles</li>
  <li>Blog posts with clever titles — but no keyword relevance</li>
</ul>
<p>From Google’s perspective, the site was like a puzzle with missing pieces. And bots hate puzzles.</p>

<h2>Case Study: Keyword-Optimized vs Brand-Optimized</h2>
<p>Before I stepped in, one of their product pages had the title: “Unlock the Power of Process.” Beautiful line. But no one searches that. After our revamp:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Old Title:</strong> Unlock the Power of Process</li>
  <li><strong>New Title:</strong> Workflow Automation Software for Manufacturing Teams</li>
</ul>
<p>Within 3 weeks, they went from page 5 to page 1 for “workflow automation manufacturing.” Leads followed soon after.</p>

<h2>SEO Tips for B2B Sites That Actually Convert</h2>
<p>Here’s the truth: design impresses people. SEO helps people find you. You need both. But here’s how SEO pulls its weight:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Use real keywords:</strong> Talk like your customer. No one Googles “synergize vertical solutions.”</li>
  <li><strong>Structure content properly:</strong> H2s, H3s, bullet points — make it crawlable and scannable.</li>
  <li><strong>Internal linking:</strong> Link related content. Spread link juice. Keep users on-site longer.</li>
  <li><strong>Add schema markup:</strong> FAQs, reviews, services — all help you show up better on search results.</li>
  <li><strong>Mobile SEO:</strong> Speed and readability on phones matter more than your desktop animations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>SEO Is a Long Game, But It Works</h2>
<p>When they started taking SEO seriously, their traffic doubled in 3 months. Their qualified leads? Tripled. And the best part — they didn’t touch the fancy visuals. They just made it understandable for Google.</p>

<h2>The Mistake Most Startups Make</h2>
<p>They treat SEO like seasoning — optional. But if no one finds your site, who cares how cool it looks? SEO is the GPS that brings people to your store.</p>
<p>And when SEO is done right, you don’t need to shout louder. You just show up when your customer is searching.</p>

<h2>Real Talk: Google Is Your First Impression</h2>
<p>Your homepage is not your first impression — Google is. If you’re not ranking, you don’t exist. Period.</p>
<p>Invest in SEO early. Don’t wait until after the site launch. It’s not a patch job. It’s the foundation.</p>

<h2>Final Words From a Tired SEO Guy</h2>
<p>If your B2B website is gorgeous but invisible, the fix isn’t another redesign. It’s an SEO-first mindset. One that treats every headline, paragraph, and link like an opportunity to show up and be useful to real people — and Google.</p>
<p>Looks impress. SEO gets clicks. The winning websites master both.</p>
