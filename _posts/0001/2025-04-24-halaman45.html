<h2>Sales Teams Are Not Magicians</h2>
<p>Let me get this off my chest — as someone who’s handled inbound B2B leads, a confusing website is the ultimate sales killer. I’ve chased leads that came in cold, uninterested, or worse — misinformed about what we do.</p>
<p>Why? Because the website promised unicorns, but we only have horses. Great ones, but still — horses.</p>

<h2>The Misalignment Between Marketing, Web, and Sales</h2>
<p>There’s often a weird gap between what the website says and what the sales team can deliver. Marketing says, “We help everyone!” Sales says, “Please no, not everyone.”</p>
<p>That disconnect causes prospects to enter calls with the wrong expectations, wasting time and tanking close rates. It's like showing up to a vegan cafe and finding bacon on the table.</p>

<h2>Real Talk: Here’s What Sales Needs From the Website</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Qualified Leads:</strong> Stop throwing us random form fills from interns doing market research.</li>
  <li><strong>Pre-Educated Visitors:</strong> We love it when prospects already understand our solution from your blog or explainer page.</li>
  <li><strong>Expectation Management:</strong> Be honest about limitations. We’d rather lose bad fits early than waste discovery calls.</li>
  <li><strong>Demo-Ready Visitors:</strong> The best leads already know why they’re booking a call. The site did half the job — now we close.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Case Study: The Lead That Ghosted</h2>
<p>Once, I got a lead from our “free trial” form. Turns out, they thought we offered a self-service platform. We’re actually enterprise-only with onboarding. That 45-minute call? Wasted. Multiply that across weeks, and you’ve got a pipeline full of noise.</p>
<p>If our website had clearly stated “Built for teams with 10+ users” and “Includes white-glove onboarding,” we’d have filtered better. Lesson learned the hard way.</p>

<h2>Fixing the Funnel With Better Copy and UX</h2>
<p>Sales teams don’t need more traffic. We need the right traffic. That means copy that speaks to the pain points of ideal customers, not everyone under the sun.</p>
<p>It also means clear CTA buttons (“Book a Demo”, not “Let’s Talk”) and logical pages that lead to conversion. A buyer journey that makes sense makes sales easier.</p>

<h2>The Content That Actually Helps Us Sell</h2>
<p>Here’s what makes a difference before that first call even happens:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ROI calculators — prospects love numbers.</li>
  <li>Comparison pages — help them choose between us and the other guys.</li>
  <li>Use case pages per industry or role — so we don’t have to explain from scratch every time.</li>
  <li>Short videos from actual users or your product team — humanizing works.</li>
</ul>

<h2>When the Website Helps Us Win</h2>
<p>I had one lead who said, “I saw your case study on logistics optimization — that’s exactly what we need.” That wasn’t luck. That was marketing and sales alignment. That lead closed in a week.</p>
<p>Your site should attract those people. The ones who already believe a solution like yours is the answer — and just need help connecting the final dots.</p>

<h2>Sales Enablement Isn’t Just Internal</h2>
<p>Too many sales teams think enablement is about decks and PDFs. But your best sales enablement tool is your website — it runs 24/7 and talks to way more people than your SDRs ever will.</p>
<p>Make it work for you. Not against you.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts From a Frustrated Sales Rep</h2>
<p>Your site is either a silent partner in closing deals — or a noisy roommate who ruins everything. If you want us to hit quota, give us a site that sets the stage for smart conversations. Not confusion.</p>
<p>And if you’re still not sure what’s broken? Ask your sales team. We’ve got stories.</p>
