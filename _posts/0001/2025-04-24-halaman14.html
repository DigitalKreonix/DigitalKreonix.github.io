<h2>Growth Needs a Strong Foundation</h2>
<p>Growth without a system is just guessing. Before scaling traffic or running campaigns, your website needs to convert. Otherwise, you're just sending leads into a leaky bucket.</p>
<p>I always start by asking: is the message clear? Is the offer strong? Is the user journey frictionless? No fancy funnel can fix a broken website experience.</p>

<h2>Tracking Is Your Best Friend</h2>
<p>As a growth marketer, I live in analytics. I need to know what people click, how far they scroll, and where they bounce. Heatmaps, GA4 events, and CRM integration are non-negotiables.</p>
<p>We once found 70% of leads dropped off at a second form step. Killed the step, leads doubled. You can’t grow what you don’t measure.</p>

<h2>Speed to Lead Wins Deals</h2>
<p>In B2B, response time is gold. We added a Calendly link and a chatbot that books meetings instantly — our SQL rate jumped 40%.</p>
<p>Make the lead feel heard right away. Speed makes your company look agile and professional. Slowness makes you look outdated.</p>

<h2>SEO Is the Long Game, But Worth It</h2>
<p>I love paid ads, but SEO has built the most consistent inbound leads. We create intent-driven content — not just blogs, but landing pages tailored to buyer stages.</p>
<p>Example: “Compare Top Project Management Tools for Mid-Sized Agencies.” That page alone brings in 500+ visits/month from high-intent prospects.</p>

<h2>Social Proof That Converts</h2>
<p>B2B buyers need reassurance. I always push for video testimonials, review badges, recognizable logos, and case studies near CTAs.</p>
<p>We ran a test: added a 2-sentence testimonial under the form. Result? 18% lift in completions. Show me, don’t tell me.</p>

<h2>Offer Value First, Ask Later</h2>
<p>Lead magnets work — but only if they’re useful. One-pagers, calculators, templates, industry benchmarks… things that solve real problems.</p>
<p>I avoid generic “Download Our Brochure” stuff. Instead: “Get the 2025 SaaS Pricing Benchmark Report.” Big difference in perceived value.</p>

<h2>Retarget Like a Human</h2>
<p>I’m not just blasting ads at everyone who visited the site. I segment based on behavior. Someone who viewed a demo video gets a “Book Now” ad. Someone who read a guide gets a “Download the Next One.”</p>
<p>Personalization isn't creepy — it's respectful when done right. The more relevant you are, the more clicks (and leads) you get.</p>

<h2>Growth Is Iteration, Not Magic</h2>
<p>No single hack or viral post will grow your B2B leads sustainably. It’s dozens of tiny improvements — copy tweaks, layout changes, CTA placements — done consistently over time.</p>
<p>The key? Stay curious. Watch the data. Ask why something worked or didn’t. Growth is a science experiment with a bit of art thrown in.</p>

<h2>Lead Gen Is a Team Sport</h2>
<p>Growth doesn’t happen in a silo. I work closely with designers, copywriters, developers, and sales. Alignment is crucial.</p>
<p>The best results come when everyone knows the end goal — more qualified leads — and builds towards it together. One team, one metric.</p>
