---

<h2>Your Website Is Your First Sales Call</h2>
<p>Most B2B deals don’t start with a handshake — they start with a homepage. If your site doesn’t clearly show who you help and how, you’ve already lost the sale before it starts.</p>
<p>Think of your website as your 24/7 SDR. It should qualify leads, warm them up, and point them toward the next step. Otherwise, it’s just fancy online wallpaper.</p>

<h2>Value First, Features Second</h2>
<p>Buyers don’t care about your 200 integrations or AI-powered dashboards — not yet. They care about results: “Will this save me time? Money? Stress?”</p>
<p>Our best-performing pages always lead with value. Then, and only then, do we talk specs. People want outcomes, not features.</p>

<h2>Use Sales Language, Not Marketing Fluff</h2>
<p>“Transform your enterprise workflows” sounds pretty, but it’s meaningless. Instead, say what you actually do — like “Track and approve invoices 3x faster.”</p>
<p>When we rewrote copy with actual sales objections in mind, conversions jumped 41%. Don’t write like a brochure — write like a closer.</p>

<h2>Shorter Funnels Convert Better</h2>
<p>Do you really need a 4-step ebook download or 10-question lead form? Probably not. Every extra step is a leak in your pipeline.</p>
<p>We trimmed our demo request form from 8 fields to 3 and saw 2.5x more submissions — with better-qualified leads. It’s not about more info, it’s about the right info.</p>

<h2>Leads Want a Conversation, Not a Chase</h2>
<p>Include calendar links. Add chat options. Use “Talk to Sales” instead of “Request Info.” Make it ridiculously easy to start a conversation.</p>
<p>And follow up fast. We close 70% more deals when we respond within 10 minutes. Time kills deals — your website should help stop the clock, not start it.</p>

<h2>Use Real Proof to Build Real Trust</h2>
<p>Testimonials, case studies, and logos from past clients are not fluff — they’re tools. Every buyer wonders: “Can I trust these guys?”</p>
<p>Our case study page converts 3x better than our pricing page. Why? Because stories sell. Especially real ones with real names and results.</p>

<h2>Stop Hiding the Pricing</h2>
<p>Yes, I know — “But our pricing is custom!” Sure. But buyers still want a ballpark. If you don’t give one, they bounce and find someone who will.</p>
<p>Even adding a “Pricing starts at…” line reduces friction. Transparency builds trust — and trust closes deals.</p>

<h2>Let Sales and Web Teams Collaborate</h2>
<p>Salespeople hear objections all day long. We know what buyers are confused about, afraid of, and excited about. That insight should shape the website — not just designers or marketers.</p>
<p>One simple change from our sales team (swapping “Request Demo” to “See It in Action”) boosted clicks by 18%. Your web copy should be written by people who sell.</p>

<h2>From Click to Close</h2>
<p>Don’t treat your website like a brochure. Treat it like your best sales rep — fast, clear, trustworthy, and ready to help.</p>
<p>The job isn’t to impress. It’s to convert. Focus on clarity, value, proof, and conversation — and watch the pipeline grow.</p>
