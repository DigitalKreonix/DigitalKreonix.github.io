<h2>Designing for Humans, Not Committees</h2>
<p>As a UX designer, I’ve watched too many good ideas die in meeting rooms. The hero section becomes a marketing slogan soup. CTAs turn into generic buttons. And don't get me started on the navigation menus — they’re built for the org chart, not the users.</p>
<p>When B2B websites fail to generate leads, it’s rarely because of the color scheme. It’s because the user journey feels like a maze designed by people who’ve never used their own product.</p>

<h2>The User Isn’t Lost — They Just Gave Up</h2>
<p>Ever tried to find pricing info on a B2B site? It’s like hunting for treasure with no map. Instead of being upfront, companies hide the good stuff behind “Contact Us” buttons. Spoiler: users don’t want to contact anyone. They want answers.</p>
<p>If you make it hard to get information, users don’t dig deeper — they bounce.</p>

<h2>Case Study: The Landing Page That Didn't Convert</h2>
<p>We once redesigned a landing page for a SaaS client. The original had a wall of text, a floating form, and an image of someone in a headset (classic). We rebuilt it with a clear headline, focused pain point, and a one-step CTA.</p>
<p>Conversion rate went from 0.9% to 4.6% in 3 weeks. Nothing fancy — just better flow and fewer distractions.</p>

<h2>UX Basics That B2B Sites Still Ignore</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Hierarchy matters:</strong> Not everything needs to be above the fold. Guide users with flow, not fear.</li>
  <li><strong>One job per page:</strong> Each page should lead to one action — not five different “learn more” links.</li>
  <li><strong>Consistency builds trust:</strong> Button styles, typography, and tone should feel like one company, not a Frankenstein.</li>
  <li><strong>Mobile isn’t optional:</strong> Buyers check sites on phones — especially in transit or between meetings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>When the Design Helps Sales (Yes, Really)</h2>
<p>One of the best feedbacks I got was from a sales rep who said, “I don’t need to explain the product anymore — they saw it all on the site.” That’s the dream. A website that does the pre-work, so your sales team can close, not educate.</p>
<p>Great UX isn’t just pretty. It’s strategic. It supports the pipeline by reducing friction and increasing confidence.</p>

<h2>Stakeholders, Please Stop Doing This</h2>
<p>Let’s talk about some real UX killers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Adding carousels because "it looks cool" — no one clicks slide 3.</li>
  <li>Requesting long forms with 9+ fields — people abandon halfway through.</li>
  <li>Insisting on jargon because "our industry expects it" — they don’t.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want leads, you have to choose clarity over internal politics. Users don’t care who approved what. They just want to find value fast.</p>

<h2>Lead Gen Starts With Empathy</h2>
<p>Your website’s job isn’t to impress your boss. It’s to connect with your buyer. And that takes empathy, not ego. It takes real research — user interviews, heatmaps, session replays — not gut feelings from someone two levels above the user.</p>
<p>When you design with empathy, you reduce friction, increase clarity, and ultimately drive more leads.</p>

<h2>Final Words From a Frustrated Designer</h2>
<p>UX isn’t just about pixels. It’s about psychology, storytelling, and flow. A good B2B site doesn’t scream “buy now.” It whispers, “you’re in the right place.”</p>
<p>So next time you redesign, start with the user — not the HiPPO (Highest Paid Person’s Opinion).</p>
