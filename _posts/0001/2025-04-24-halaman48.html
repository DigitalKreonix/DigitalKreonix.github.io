<h2>When Smart Products Have Boring Pages</h2>
<p>As a copywriter, I’ve seen it all. Amazing B2B solutions hidden behind robotic language and buzzword soup. “Next-gen scalable architecture” sounds fancy, but it doesn’t say anything real to the buyer.</p>
<p>One client had a page so stuffed with jargon, even the CEO couldn’t explain it in plain English. No surprise — no leads either.</p>

<h2>Case Study: The $500 Word That Made $50K</h2>
<p>We changed a button label from “Schedule a Consultation” to “Let’s Talk.” That’s it. One small word tweak. Result? 3× more clicks. One new client worth $50,000.</p>
<p>Turns out, people like clicking on things that feel human.</p>

<h2>What B2B Copy Gets Wrong</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>It tries to sound smart,</strong> but ends up confusing.</li>
  <li><strong>It talks about features,</strong> not problems it solves.</li>
  <li><strong>It uses generic CTAs,</strong> not specific next steps.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember: even in B2B, you’re selling to *people* — not acronyms.</p>

<h2>Better Copy = Better Leads</h2>
<p>Great B2B copy does a few things well:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Simplifies value:</strong> Say what it is, what it does, and why it matters.</li>
  <li><strong>Uses natural language:</strong> If it sounds weird out loud, rewrite it.</li>
  <li><strong>Adds clarity over cleverness:</strong> “We fix your workflows” > “Optimizing synergistic collaboration.”</li>
</ul>

<h2>Don’t Hide Your Personality</h2>
<p>One client let us rewrite their “About” section with real stories, team photos, and humor. Their bounce rate dropped by 25%. Why? Because people want to work with people they like — not faceless corporations.</p>

<h2>From Invisible to Irresistible</h2>
<p>You don’t need to rewrite your entire site. Just start with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Homepage hero headline</li>
  <li>Top three service pages</li>
  <li>Contact page CTA</li>
</ul>
<p>Make them clearer, friendlier, and more direct. That alone can double your conversions.</p>

<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>If your B2B site isn’t converting, look at your words. Design draws them in — but copy makes them act. Don’t waste traffic with lifeless text. Speak like a human. Sell like a pro.</p>
