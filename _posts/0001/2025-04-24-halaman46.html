---

<p>For years, Google AdSense was my go-to for blog monetization. It's like the old reliable car — it gets the job done, but there’s always that curiosity about the shiny new model. And let’s be honest, AdSense isn’t what it used to be. The RPMs have dropped, policies feel stricter, and approval time? Longer than your average Netflix binge session.</p><p>So, I went hunting. Not with a spear and a loincloth — just a keyboard and insomnia-fueled curiosity. I’ve tested and tinkered with various ad networks over the last 18 months and the results? Let’s just say some of them gave AdSense a serious run for its money. In this post, I’ll walk you through the top-paying ad networks that performed exceptionally on my blogs and websites, complete with juicy RPM details and personal experiences.</p><h2>Why I Started Looking Beyond AdSense</h2>
<p>AdSense had been underwhelming for a while. My content is evergreen and SEO-optimized, traffic mostly from US, Canada, and the UK — yet the RPMs were barely scratching $2. Ads felt repetitive, and even worse, sometimes they were irrelevant to the content.</p>
<p>I wanted more revenue. But also, more relevance. And importantly, a platform that respected my blog's design and speed. That led me to explore the wild west of ad networks.</p><h2>Criteria I Used to Evaluate the Networks</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Minimum Payout:</strong> The lower, the better.</li>
  <li><strong>Approval Process:</strong> Some networks treat you like royalty, others make you feel like a beggar.</li>
  <li><strong>RPM (Revenue per 1000 Impressions):</strong> My baseline was $2.5+</li>
  <li><strong>Ad Quality:</strong> Visual appeal, relevance, and load speed.</li>
  <li><strong>Payment Method:</strong> PayPal is king in my world.</li>
</ul><h2>1. Ezoic – The Smart AI That Pays Well</h2>
<p>Ezoic surprised me. It uses AI to test ad placements and increase revenue over time. The onboarding is detailed (slightly annoying at first), but once it’s set up, the RPM improvements are noticeable.</p>
<p>For one of my blogs in the education niche, I hit an average RPM of $12.63. That’s 6x better than AdSense. Plus, their support actually talks to you — like a human, not a robot with canned responses.</p><h2>2. Media.net – Contextual Ads Done Right</h2>
<p>Run by Yahoo! and Bing, Media.net thrives on contextual targeting. If your content is text-heavy and targeted at Western countries, it works wonderfully. I used it on a niche finance blog, and saw RPMs around $7.40 — consistently.</p>
<p>The only caveat: approval is selective. I got in on my second try after tweaking my About page and making the design look cleaner.</p><h2>3. PropellerAds – Great for Pop and Push</h2>
<p>Let me be honest — not for everyone. If you’re running a blog that’s okay with push notifications or pop-unders, PropellerAds is aggressive, but it pays. I made around $5/day from a micro-niche site with barely 600 daily visitors.</p>
<p>They pay via PayPal and the minimum payout is just $5. I use it on sites I don’t care too much about in terms of UX. Not recommended for your main brand.</p><h2>4. AdThrive – The Premium Dream</h2>
<p>AdThrive is like the VIP lounge of ad networks. The catch? You need at least 100,000 monthly pageviews — mostly from the US. Once you're in, RPMs can go north of $20. Yes, twenty. I’ve seen it. A friend running a food blog showed me his dashboard and I nearly cried with envy.</p>
<p>If you’re scaling up, this is where you want to end up. They even have designers who help you optimize layouts.</p><h2>5. Monumetric – The Friendly Alternative</h2>
<p>Monumetric sits between Ezoic and AdThrive. Minimum traffic is 10,000 monthly views, and there’s a $99 setup fee (waived for higher tiers). They handle everything — setup, optimization, and support.</p>
<p>One lifestyle blog I ran got a stable RPM of $8.70. The ads were classy, never slowed down my site, and payment always came on time.</p><h2>6. SHE Media – Best for Female-Centric Audiences</h2>
<p>This one’s niche — for blogs that cater to women. Fashion, parenting, wellness? You’re in luck. SHE Media has strong partnerships with big brands and I’ve seen RPMs between $5–$10.</p>
<p>They also offer influencer campaigns, which means extra income streams outside traditional display ads.</p><h2>Case Study: From $2 to $9.83 RPM in 3 Weeks</h2>
<p>Let me give you a practical breakdown. One of my blogs focused on remote work tips. With AdSense, it was getting around $2.17 RPM. After switching to Ezoic and tweaking placements based on heatmap feedback, the RPM jumped to $9.83 — within 3 weeks.</p>
<p>The traffic stayed the same. Only the ad network changed. And that alone increased monthly earnings from $130 to nearly $600.</p><h2>My Personal Recommendation</h2>
<p>If you’re just starting and have decent traffic (10K+ monthly), go with Ezoic. If you’re building toward premium, aim for AdThrive. Running edgy content or viral sites? Try PropellerAds. And if you’re somewhere in between, Media.net or Monumetric can be solid picks.</p>
<p>Test everything. Track results. And never settle for a network just because it’s popular.</p><h2>Final Thoughts: The Ad Network Game Is Always Evolving</h2>
<p>Monetizing your blog is both a science and an art. Algorithms change. Ad prices fluctuate. But one thing remains constant — experimentation pays. Sometimes literally.</p>
<p>Don’t put all your eggs in the AdSense basket. There’s a world of ad networks out there just waiting to outperform the big G. All it takes is a bit of effort, some trial and error, and maybe a few cups of coffee (or ten).</p><script type="application/ld+json">
